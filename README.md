# arXiv3r
Discord bot for arXiv linking. More features will hopefully be added soon. Although in the words of the famous me, "just search for the identifier you bozo".

# What's new in v2.

In v2, you can now have multiple requests in the same message. Next, you can subscribe to authors using [au:name] and get notified when the author uploads a paper on arXiv. Finally, you can get bibtex citations by using [bib:yymm.nnnn]. Enjoy!

# Privacy Policy

We do not collect any info. The bot lives in your server and identifies arXiv links.

# Terms and Conditions

Don't link modified gravity papers because they suuuuuuuuck.
